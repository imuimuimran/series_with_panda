# Example of using the pandas Series object

import pandas as pd

# Creating a Series from a list
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
series = pd.Series(data)
print(series)

# Creating a Series with custom index labels
index = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
series_with_index = pd.Series(data, index=index)
print(series_with_index)

# Statistical operations on a Series
print(series.mean())  # Calculating the mean of the Series
print(series.std())  # Calculating the standard deviation of the Series
